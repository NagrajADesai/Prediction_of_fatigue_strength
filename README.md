## Fatigue-Testing

Fatigue testing is a specialised form of mechanical testing that is performed by applying cyclic loading to a coupon or structure.           
These tests are used either to generate fatigue life and crack growth data, identify critical locations or demonstrate the safety of a structure that may be susceptible to fatigue.

Fatigue is the progressive, localized, permanent structural change that occurs in materials subjected to fluctuating stresses and strains that may result in cracks or fractures after a sufficient number of fluctuations.
